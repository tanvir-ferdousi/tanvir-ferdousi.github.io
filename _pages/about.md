Welcome! I am a computer science researcher and software engineer. I currently work with [Akkodis, Inc.](https://www.akkodis.com/) and contribute to [General Motors (GM) R&D](https://www.gm.com/research) as a research engineer in computer vision and networking.

I earned my Ph.D. in Electrical and Computer Engineering from Kansas State University in 2021, advised by [Dr. Caterina Scoglio](https://ece.k-state.edu/about/people/faculty/scoglio/). My [dissertation](https://krex.k-state.edu/handle/2097/41449) focused on computational epidemiology. After graduation, I worked as a postdoc at the [University of Virginia Biocomplexity Institute](https://biocomplexity.virginia.edu/), contributing to projects such as [CINES](https://biocomplexity.virginia.edu/project/cines-cyberinfrastructure-network-engineering-and-science) and [AgAID](https://agaid.org/).

Before grad school, I spent several years at [Samsung R&D Institute Bangladesh](https://research.samsung.com/srbd), where I led development teams and worked on network connectivity, IoT applications, and software QA. I received my bachelorâ€™s degree in Electrical and Electronic Engineering from [BUET](https://www.buet.ac.bd/) in 2013.
