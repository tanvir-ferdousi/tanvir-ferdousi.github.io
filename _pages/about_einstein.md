Welcome! I am a computer science researcher and a software engineer. I work at the intersection of AI/Machine Learning, high performance computing, big data analytics, and network science.

I work as a postdoctoral [research associate](https://biocomplexity.virginia.edu/person/tanvir-ferdousi) at the Network Systems Science and Advanced Computing Division of the UVA Biocomplexity Institute. As a postdoc, I am engaged in multiple projects, including CINES and AgAID. As a part of the [CINES](https://biocomplexity.virginia.edu/project/cines-cyberinfrastructure-network-engineering-and-science) initiative, I work with the team to develop large-scale graph analytics tools, optimize performance, and deploy them in a software-as-a-service (SaaS) [platform](https://net.science/). As a part of the [AgAID](https://agaid.org/) project, I collaborate with researchers from agro, hydro, and environmental systems domains to bring artificial intelligence (AI) based solutions for improving water management, allocation, and more.

I graduated with a Ph.D. in Electrical and Computer Engineering from Kansas State University in 2021, where [Dr. Caterina Scoglio](https://ece.k-state.edu/about/people/faculty/scoglio/) supervised me. My [dissertation](https://krex.k-state.edu/handle/2097/41449) contributed to improving tools and data management for computational epidemiology. Before graduate school, I was a software engineer at [Samsung R&D Institute Bangladesh](https://research.samsung.com/srbd) for 3.5 years. I have managed a team of developers, built network connectivity and IoT applications, and performed software quality assurance. I received my bachelor's degree in Electrical and Electronic Engineering from Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology (BUET) in 2013.
