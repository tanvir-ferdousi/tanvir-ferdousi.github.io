        - title: A CyberInfrastructure for Network Engineering and Science (CINES)
          contents:
            - Developed graph analytics tools capable of large-scale computations (~10^6 nodes/edges) in a software as a service (SaaS) architecture using HPC backend.
            - Mentored a student in developing a financial contagion simulator using the Eisenberg-Noe model to evaluate the impact of bailout strategies in reducing cascading failures in bank lending networks.
        - title: AI Institute for Transforming Workforce & Decision Support (AgAID)
          contents:
            - Developed an explainable AI (XAI) framework for geospatial data using Shapley analysis in combination with supervised (random forest) and unsupervised (k-means clustering) learning. The framework was used to evaluate the impact of climate change on water availability and crop yield in the Western United States.
            - Designed and deployed a high performance computing pipeline for automated preprocessing, batch job submission, monitoring, and postprocessing of VIC-CropSyst simulation in UVA’s Rivanna HPC clusters
            - Mentored a student to develop an Asymmetric Nash Bargaining framework to model negotiations among California, Arizona, and Nevada to curtail the usage of Colorado River’s water.
            - Developed an integer linear programming (ILP) optimizer using Gurobi for matching buyers and sellers in bipartite networks representing river water rights markets.
